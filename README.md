Estimating Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf area density, and leaf inclination angles using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (Boise Center Aerospace Lab and SPRUCE)

**Welcome! And thank you for the opportunity.**

Goal
------------

The main goal of this project is to estimate annual canopy structural metrics for SPRUCE plots from August 2015 - August 2022. To do so, we use a voxel-based contact frequency model. In this model, the  occupied voxels are quantified for each canopy layer, providing the leaf area density of each layer. Summing these layers results in the LAI. The vegetation structural data were measured from twelve plots (12 m x 12 m) in the Marcell Experimental Forest in northern Minnesota, USA. The lidar data comes from a Riegl VZ-1000 TLS with a 1550 nm laser. The original data is publically available:
